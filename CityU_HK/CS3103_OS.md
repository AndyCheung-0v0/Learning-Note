# CS3103 Operating System (OS)
## Ch1 Introduction
### What is OS
- resource allocator
- program controller
- Interrupt driven
### Bootstrap program (aka firmware)
- stored in ROM
- 
---
## Ch2 OS Structure
### OS services
- Helpful for user
    - UI
    - 
- Helpful for efficient operation
### Command Line interpreter

### System Call
what use api

### System Program

### Linker & Loader (xx: not in exam)

### OS design

### Kernel type (!!: test benefits and drawback)
- Monolithic kernel
- Microkernels

---

## Ch3 Process
### Process
- Process is a program in execution
### Process stste (!!)

### PCB (!!)

### Context Switch

### IPC: InterProcess Communication (!!: test benefits and drawback) 
- independent or cooperating
- 2 models of IPC
    - Shared memory
    - Message passing

### Implementation of Communication Link
- Physical
- Logical

### Naming
- Direct Communication
- Indirect Communication

### Pipe (xx)

---
## Ch4 Thread
### user thread and kernel thread
- user thread
    - posix pthread
    - windows thread
    - java thread
- kernel thread
- User thread to kernel thread model
    - 1-1: One to one model
    - m-1: Many to one model
    - m-m: Many to Many model
    - 2Lv: Two level model

### Implicit Threading (!!: thread pool only)

### advantages of thread pool (!!)

---
## Ch5 CPU Scheduling
### Preemptive & Nonpreemptive

### Scheduling Criteria

### FCFS: first come first served scheduling

### SJF
- non-preemptive
- premptive

### Determining Length of Next CPU Burst (xx) 

### RR: Round Robin scheduling
- q: time quantum
- q large -> FIFO
- q small -> RR 

### priority scheduling
- problem => starvation
- solution => Aging

### multilevel queue

---
## Ch6 Synchronization

### Race condition

### Critical Section Problem

### solution of critical section problem
- mutual exclusion
- progress
- bounded waiting

### synchronization hardware

- Atomic = non-interruptable

### semaphore

### classic problems of synchronization
- Bounded-buffer problem (!!)
- Reader & writer problem (!!)
- dining-philosophers problem & monitor(xx)

---
## Ch7 Deadlock
### Deadlock Characterization
### Resource-Allocation Graph
### deadlock prevention

### deadlock avoidance
### safe state
### banker algorithm

---

## Ch8 Memory Management
### Logical address vs Physical address
- Logical address: seen by CPU
- Physical address: seen by DRAM

### MMU: Memory-management unit
- [CPU] -(logic addr.)-> [MMU] -(physic addr.)-> [Phy.Memory]
